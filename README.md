# Labs-from-ME273
Here are some labs I worked through I will try to make them as clear as possible.

The ME EN 273 class at BYU focuses on C++ and MATLAB.

I will be posting the source codes to each lab as I complete them.

Lab0- Hello World: Yep that simple. It was for getting started and setting up VS code for those who had never coded before.

Lab1- Mean Calculator: A program that will calculate the mean of 4 user inputs. 3 different cases with varyiing variable types to show the difference between ints and floats
